# 1. Ask

Starting Dataset: [Excel Project Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24042478/Excel.Project.Dataset.xlsx) raw dataset containing detailed bike customer details.

In Excel, 1 sheet is included in the dataset: bike_buyers

# 3. Process 

I began by creating three new sheets in Excel: Working Sheet, Pivot Table, and Dashboard.

Next, I copied the original bike_buyers dataset into the Working Sheet to keep the source data intact.

After that, I reviewed the dataset to understand the fields available and identify what could be analyzed.

# Checking For Duplicate Values

I began by checking the dataset for duplicate entries. To do this, I selected the entire sheet, went to the Data tab, and used the Remove Duplicates feature. I selected all columns to ensure a full check across the dataset, which resulted in 26 duplicate rows being removed.
